        <p>Hi my name is Steven and I am 19 years old. I am Dominican but born and raised in New York. I didn't have enough experience socializing with other people so I'm really shy around people but once I get comfortable around you thats when my personality shines. I used art as a way to help me express myself and just have a hobby. I enjoy spending most of my time drawing, playing games with friends,listening to music and watching animations. Playing sports wasn't really my thing but I like playing baseball, football and occasionally soccer.</p>
